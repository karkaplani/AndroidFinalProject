# Triviapo

Final project for Android Development class. Other parts of the project, which are not included in this repo, were done by my teammates: Gabriel Matte, Jordan Passant and Andrew O'Hara. Trivia API was my part. XML design, Turkish and English string files, async task, JSON parsing, database connectivity, game tracking etc were used in the project. All done by Kotlin (Self-taught).
